<h1> KUSOO DHAWADA WARARKA CIYAARAH:</h1>

<p>Argentina has won the 2022 World Cup in Lusail, Qatar, defeating France with a 3-3 (4-2 penalty) final score after a nail-bitting match that concluded in a penalty shootout.

The first half of the match saw Argentina claim a 2-0 lead thanks to goals from Angel Di Maria and the legendary Lionel Messi, who played his final World Cup today. With a penalty kick 23 minutes in, Messi became the first man in FIFA World Cup history to score in all five rounds at a single tournament.

Progressing into the second half, Argentina looked to secure their lead (and avoid exhausting their players) by slowing down their play—but France soon rallied to a tie with two consecutive goals from Kylian Mbappé, the team’s 23-year-old star player. (Mbappé impressively earned both points within two minutes of each other, causing French fans—among them an effusive Emmanuel Macron—to go wild.)

During extra time, Messi scored for Argentina yet again, bringing the score to 3-2, before Mbappé pulled off a hat trick, forcing a tie-breaking shootout at 3-3. While Mbappé and Randal Kolo Muani went on to convert their penalties for France, misses from Kingsley Coman and Aurelien Tchouameni cleared the way for an Argentine win, after Messi, Paulo Dybala, Leandro Paredes, and finally 25-year-old Gonzalo Montiel all found the back of the net, clinching the match. </p>

<h1> BAYERN OO PSG ka reebtey champions league oo ku garacdey 3-0 labadii lugba  </h1>

Sommer attempted to dribble out of his box and Achraf Hakimi pressured him into presenting the ball to Vitinha who rolled a shot past the goalkeeper towards an empty net only for the Holland international to slide in and hook clear.

Just prior to that PSG had lost captain Marquinhos to injury, allowing the club's record goalscorer Kylian Mbappe to take the armband but the additional responsibility could not inspire any heroics from the France striker.

The closest he came all night was as early as the 14th minute when he had the ball in the net but the whistle had already gone for a foul as he had clattered into Sommer on the edge of the penalty area.

Bayern's defensive resilience in Europe this season - this was their seventh clean sheet in eight matches - meant even a side featuring Mbappe and Lionel Messi faltered as PSG failed to get past the last 16 stage for the fifth time in seven years.

L
iverpool brought Manchester United crashing down to earth in a stunning 7-0 rout in the Premier League at Anfield on Sunday.

Cody Gakpo, Darwin Nunez and Mohamed Salah all struck twice and Roberto Firmino scored the other, with six of the goals coming in an explosive second-half performance.

The defeat was Erik ten Hag’s heaviest as United manager and seriously hampered his four-pronged pursuit of trophies, with a Premier League title challenge now looking increasingly unlikely.
